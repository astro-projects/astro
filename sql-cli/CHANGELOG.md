# Changelog

## 0.4.0 (Astro CLI 1.11.0)

### Features

* Deployment to Astro Software ([#1522](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/issues/1522))

* Support to run a single SQL CLI workflow task ([#1766](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1766)):

```
    astro flow run <workflow> --task-id load_imdb_movies
```

### Others

* Render SQL in Airflow UI ([#1003](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/issues/1003))
* Update compatibility matrix to support matching minor digits ([#1673](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/issues/1673))
* Add developer documentation ([#1534](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/issues/1534))


## 0.3.2 (Astro CLI 1.10.0)

Pin Python SDK to 1.4.x, so the SQL CLI and Astro CLI are not affected by breaking changes introduced in the project.


## 0.3.1

### Features

* Add flag --json to the flow version command ([#1653](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1653))

### Others

* Refactor flow deploy command so the workflow name is a CLI argument as opposed to a flag ([#1660](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1660))
* Fix markdown ([#1649](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1649))


## 0.3.0

### Features

For more information on the features, please, check their help or access: https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/sql-cli.html

1. Deployment to Astro Cloud

The main feature of this release is exposed in the Astro CLI 1.10, through the command:

```sh
astro flow deploy
```

Related tickets:
* Allow SQL CLI users to define scheduling and other DAG metadata using YML ([#1614](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1614))
* Add flow deploy command ([#1615](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1615))

2. Examples runnable from Astro CLI

SQL CLI examples can now run in the Astro CLI when the user uses

```sh
astro dev init
astro flow init --data-dir=./include
```

Related tickets:
* Add configurable data dir to project init ([#1407](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1407))

3. Improved troubleshooting

We are exposing additional logs when users use one or both of the following flags:

```sh
astro flow --debug <cmd> --verbose
```

Related tickets:
* Add global debug option and more verbose options to sql-cli ([#1177](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1177))

4. Improvements in DAG generation

Allow users to export SQL workflows as DAGs to custom output directories

```sh
astro flow generate <workflow-name> --output-dir <>
```

Related tickets:
* Add output-dir option to flow generate ([#1533](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1533))


### Breaking changes

1. The `flow config` was split into two (`get` / `set`). The consequence of this breaking change is that the Astro CLI 1.8 and 1.9 flow commands will not work as expected. Users should upgrade to the latest version of the Astro CLI to be able to use the SQL CLI features:

```
sudo bash < <(curl -sSL https://install.astronomer.io) -s v1.10.0
```

Related ticket:
* Expose get/set deployment config in SQL CLI ([#1479](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1479))

2. The global configuration is no longer a directory but a file. Previously created SQL CLI projects will no longer work with this new release unless this change is manually applied:

The `config/global/configuration.yml` should be moved to `config/global.yml`.

Related ticket:
* Move file config/global/configuration.yml -> config/global.yml ([#1409](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1409))


### Others

* Add error message for validate connections ([#1554](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1554))

* Disable logging for non-debug mode ([#1569](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1569))
* Add developer docs ([#1577](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1577))
* Fix poetry nox integration ([#1570](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1570))

## 0.2.2


### Breaking changes

Projects created with previous versions of the SQL CLI will need to be reinitialised, so they respect
the new configuration structure, implemented as part of the bug fix #1230.
It's recommended to back up any previous configuration.

Before the config structure was:
```
config/
├── default
│   └── configuration.yml
└── dev
    └── configuration.yml

```

Now it is:

```
config/
├── default
│   └── configuration.yml
├── dev
│   └── configuration.yml
└── global
    └── configuration.yml

```

The global configuration contains environment-agnostic properties which were previously (incorrectly) set in the environment-specific settings:

```
airflow:
  dags_folder: /home/tati/Code/astro-sdk/sql-cli/test-0.2.2/dags
  home: /home/tati/Code/astro-sdk/sql-cli/test-0.2.2/.airflow/default

```


### Bug fixes

* Fix misplacement of generated DAGs by introducing the concept of global configuration #1230
* Change validate to only check the connection of interest if the flag --connection is given #1370
* Fix connection not found issue #1124
* Improve error message when the remote connection can't be established #1366
* Fix verbose logging #1368
* Fix validate connection ID matching #1361
* Support Airflow 2.2 #1162

### Improvements

* Improve how Airflow configuration is set/retrieved #1219
* Improve generated DAGs (using black) #1362
* Astro CLI end-to-end integration tests #1234
* Run tests against multiple versions of Airflow #1055
