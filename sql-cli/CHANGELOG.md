# Changelog

## 0.2.2


### Breaking changes

Projects created with previous versions of the SQL CLI will need to be reinitialised, so they respect
the new configuration structure, implemented as part of the bug fix #1230.
It's recommended to back up any previous configuration.

Before the config structure was:
```
config/
├── default
│   └── configuration.yml
└── dev
    └── configuration.yml

```

Now it is:

```
config/
├── default
│   └── configuration.yml
├── dev
│   └── configuration.yml
└── global
    └── configuration.yml

```

The global configuration contains environment-agnostic properties which were previously (incorrectly) set in the environment-specific settings:

```
airflow:
  dags_folder: /home/tati/Code/astro-sdk/sql-cli/test-0.2.2/dags
  home: /home/tati/Code/astro-sdk/sql-cli/test-0.2.2/.airflow/default

```


### Bug fixes

* Fix misplacement of generated DAGs by introducing the concept of global configuration #1230
* Change validate to only check the connection of interest if the flag --connection is given #1370
* Fix connection not found issue #1124
* Improve error message when the remote connection can't be established #1366

* Support Airflow 2.2 #1162

### Improvements

* Improve how Airflow configuration is set/retrieved #1219
* Improve generated DAGs (using black) #1362
* Astro CLI end-to-end integration tests #1234
* Run tests against multiple versions of Airflow #1055
