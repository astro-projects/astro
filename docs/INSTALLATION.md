# Installing Astro

The astro project lives in this [pypi repo](https://pypi.org/project/astro-projects/)
To add the library to your dev environment, run this command:

```shell script
pip install astro-projects
```

If you are running Airflow using the [astro cli](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/cloud/stable/develop/cli-quickstart), you can add `astro-projects` to your `requirements.txt`
