# Installing Astro

The astro project lives in this [pypi repo](https://pypi.org/project/astro-sdk-python/)
To add the library to your dev environment, run this command:

```shell script
pip install astro-sdk-python
```

If you are running Airflow using the [astro cli](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/cloud/stable/develop/cli-quickstart), you can add `astro-sdk-python` to your `requirements.txt`
